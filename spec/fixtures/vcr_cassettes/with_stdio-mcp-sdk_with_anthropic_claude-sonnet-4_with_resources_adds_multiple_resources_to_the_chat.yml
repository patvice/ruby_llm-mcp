        on the provided resources, I have access to the following information:\n\n##
        File Contents:\n\n### 1. **plain_text.txt**\n- Contains: \"Plan text information\"\n-
        This appears to be a simple plain text file with minimal content\n\n### 2.
        **test.txt** \n- Contains a sample text with the following content:\n  - \"Hello,
        this is a test file!\"\n  - \"This content will be served by the MCP resource.\"\n  -
        \"You can modify this file and it will be cached for 5 minutes.\"\n- This
        seems to be a demonstration file explaining MCP (Model Context Protocol) resource
        caching behavior\n\n### 3. **second_file.txt**\n- Contains: \"This is the
        second file that I want to be able to use as a resource\"\n- Another text
        file designated for use as a resource\n\n### 4. **my.md** (Markdown file)\n-
        A structured markdown document with:\n  - Main heading: \"My Markdown File\"
        \n  - Introduction text about it being a resource file\n  - Two sections:\n    -
