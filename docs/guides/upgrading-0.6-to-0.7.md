## Breaking Changes

### RubyLLM 1.9 Requirement

Version 0.7 requires RubyLLM 1.9 or higher. Make sure to update your `ruby_llm` dependency:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'ruby_llm', '~> 1.9'
gem 'ruby_llm-mcp', '~> 0.7'
```

Then run:

```bash
bundle update ruby_llm ruby_llm-mcp
```

## Deprecated Features

### Complex Parameters Support (Now Default)

{: .warning }
The `support_complex_parameters!` method is deprecated and will be removed in version 0.8.0.

**What Changed:**

In version 0.6.x and earlier, you had to explicitly enable complex parameter support for MCP tools to handle arrays and nested objects:

```ruby
# Version 0.6.x (OLD - deprecated)
RubyLLM::MCP.configure do |config|
  config.support_complex_parameters!
end
```

**In version 0.7.x, complex parameters are supported by default.** You no longer need to call this method.
